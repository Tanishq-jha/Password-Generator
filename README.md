# Password-Generator
 JavaScript-powered password generator.

 Password Generator project is a JavaScript-based web application designed to create strong and randomized passwords effortlessly. JavaScript serves as the backbone, orchestrating the entire functionality of the application from password generation to user interaction.

Using JavaScript's capabilities, the application generates passwords with customizable parameters such as length and character set. It employs secure randomization techniques to ensure the strength of the generated passwords.

The user interface, managed by JavaScript, provides intuitive controls for users to specify their desired password criteria and generate passwords accordingly. Asynchronous operations are handled gracefully, allowing for seamless password generation without compromising user experience.

Error handling mechanisms are implemented within the JavaScript codebase to address scenarios such as invalid inputs or unexpected errors during password generation. This ensures a robust and reliable application experience for users.
